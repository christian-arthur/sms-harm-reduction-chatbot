Educating individuals about harm reduction services empowers them to make decisions that reduce their risk. Many great online resources exist, describing different harm reduction programs. But people who are unsheltered or poor may have limited data on their phones, hampering their ability to access the resources. Public WiFi has imperfect coverage.</p>

                        <p>This SMS-based chatbot allows anyone to learn about harm reduction resources, simply by texting a phone number! The SMS interface makes it easy to navigate information about Syringe Services Programs, Naloxone and Overdose Training, Shelter, and more. App users can find address information and a phone number to contact. The chatbot is free and the newest update connects people to helplines! This is NOT artificial intelligence like ChatGPT but a simpler design like old AOL Instant Messenger bots.</p>

The bot only costs between $.0079 and $.02 per text it receives and sends, so most utilizations will cost less than a dollar. Efficient public health! (Right now the bot is a proof-of-concept and is seeded with a small amount of money from the developer for demonstration purposes. If there's the demand for a sustainable service then the developer will explore Patreon, grats, or other funding models. </p>

For example, in Massachusetts the drug supply has seen changes like <a href="https://www.info.streetcheck.org/street-narcotics-updates-alerts">xylazine and new opioids.</a> The app developer integrated an emergency alert system into the harm reduction chatbot to notify participants about emergent risks. Individuals sign up via SMS and the chatbot. Administrators <a href="{{ url_for('website.admin_login') }}">sign in to their gated dashboard here</a>, sending out text blasts.

                        <p>Perceived stigma is a barrier to people seeking out services. The chatbot applies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2 hashing function</a> to anonymize phone numbers it interacts with, so app users can feel comfortable about exploring harm reduction services. All activity on the app is anonymized. The emergency alerts system requires recording the subcriber's phone number, but it's opt-in.</p>
